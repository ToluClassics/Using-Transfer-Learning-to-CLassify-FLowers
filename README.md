# Using-Transfer-Learning-to-CLassify-FLowers
VGGNet is great because it's simple and has great performance, coming in second in the ImageNet competition. The idea here is that we keep all the convolutional layers, but **replace the final fully-connected layer** with our own classifier. This way we can use VGGNet as a _fixed feature extractor_ for our images then easily train a simple classifier on top of that.
